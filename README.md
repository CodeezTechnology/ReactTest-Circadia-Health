# ReactTest-Circadia-Health
Senior ReactJS/JavaScript Developer - Circadia Health : In this challenge you will be given a REST API that converts a number into a square root. To get the data, make an API GET call to the   URL:https://gxxph4h9l6.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/front_end_hiring?input=[number]  The API call has an inherent delay of approximately 5 s, the user should be made aware that the calculation is being processed during this time.  An example of a result of input = 16 is as follows:  {"result": 4.0}  We would like you to:  Create a website application using ‘create-react-app’ as a template https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app, that includes an input form where the user can input a number e.g.‘16’ then click a button named ‘calculate square root’. Following the click of the ‘calculate square root’ button the square root of the number is then rendered below e.g. ‘4’.   Perform a JEST unit test on your React JS code.  Our expectation is that:  We receive high quality code that is production ready. This should handle all reasonable edge cases such as timeout of the API call, incorrect input and any other you can think of.  The code should have a sufficient amount of unit tests developed to ensure it is correctly functioning.
